## Use Case

This use case aims to show api-rest generation capabilities of this project. 

To easy work with and successfully performs this use case , a Dockerfile is provide with all dependencies requires to 
generate and run Api-Rest services, so user requires Docker engine installed in his default
operation system. 

This use case provides 3 scenarios to cover the 3 technologies supported by.

Open generator environment docker base

```
make run-env
```

This instruction will open a bash command-line inside a docker-container
with this project mounted as current workspace, so user can start to generate
